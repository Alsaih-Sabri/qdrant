Qdrant (read: quadrant ) is a vector similarity search engine. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points - vectors with an additional payload.

This CLI starts a Qdrant peer/server.

Usage: qdrant[EXE] [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --bootstrap <URI>
          Uri of the peer to bootstrap from in case of multi-peer deployment. If not specified - this peer will be considered as a first in a new deployment

      --uri <URI>
          Uri of this peer. Other peers should be able to reach it by this uri.
          
          This value has to be supplied if this is the first peer in a new deployment.
          
          In case this is not the first peer and it bootstraps the value is optional. If not supplied then qdrant will take internal grpc port from config and derive the IP address of this peer on bootstrap peer (receiving side)
